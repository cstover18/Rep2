For my data analysis project, I found data from the Times Record Tornado Archive, detailing the number of tornados
experienced by the state of Arkansas every year from 1950 to 2022.

         According to the graph, while there are outliers, there is a slight upward trend, suggesting the rate of tornados in the state has increased through the years.}
